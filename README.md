# CSE-616-WUW-Detector-Project
This project aims to use Neural Network Architectures to develop a wake up word detector. The detector is inspired from the work of Shilei Zhang and Pritish Mishra. The aim of this project is to test the architecture used in Wake up word detection of a recent paper and test its viability. Important references are:

1- Pritish Mishra wake up word detection: https://github.com/pritishmishra703/WakeWordDetection
The work of Mishra inspired the workflow and file usage of this project, but different implementations of Neural network and dataset is used.

2- Wake-up-word spotting using end-to-end deep neural network system published by Shilei Zhang, Wen Liu, Yong Qin https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7900073
This paper inspired the main neural network architecture.
